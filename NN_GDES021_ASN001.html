    <h1>This is the Main Heading</h1>
    <p>
      This text might be an introduction to the rest of the page. And if the
      page is a long one it might be split up into several sub-headings.
    </p>

    <!-- add a long line here -->

    <h2>This is a Sub-Heading</h2>
    <p>
      Many long articles have sub-headings so to help you follow the structure
      of what is being written. <br />
      There may even be sub-sub-headings (or lower-level headings) What should
      this be?
    </p>

    <h3>Another Sub-Heading</h3>
    <p>
      Here you can see another sub-heading. But should this be a heading?
      Probably not. Too much info/text now.
    </p>
    <span>right?</span>

    <!-- add a few "breaks" here to create some space! **hint** you can also use these to break sentences into new lines... as it was intended to be used! try using one in the middle of a paragraph and see what happens in your browser-->
    <br />
    <h4>And Another Sub-Heading</h4>
    <p>More headings??</p>
    <h5>Here you can see another sub-heading.</h5>
    <p>You know what to do now. Let's use a proper tag.</p>
    <h6>Yet <em>Another</em> Sub-Heading</h6>
    <p>That's a lot of headings.</p>
    <h6>Here you can see another sub-heading.</h6>
    <p>
      You know what to do now. Make this <strong>WORD</strong> strong aka bold.
      Give it a proper tag!

      in the air.

    <!-- try using the "abbr" tag just like it's used in the book for the line below -->

    <p>
      In case you were wondering, here is
      <abbr title="Professor">Prof</abbr> John Doe's address!
    </p>

    <!-- Make each line for the address appears on a new line, starting with the name -->

    <address>
      <p>John Doe<br />Fruitvale Ave<br />Saratoga, CA 95070</p>
    </address>
