            Project Description: Infant-Directed Speech (IDS), also known as
            baby-talk, is characterized by higher pitch, longer word duration, a
            wider pitch range, and more word repetition in comparison to
            Adult-Directed Speech (ADS). In this research study we investigated
            whether infant vocabulary size correlates with parentsâ€™ pitch range
            and/or the number of target word repetitions the parent produces.

            Project Description: Voice assistants such as Alexa and Siri are now
            commonly used in the home and everyday life, yet our scientific
            understanding of these interactions is still in its infancy. This
            study tests how people of different ages (college-age adults and
            children, ages 7-12) talk to an Alexa device versus a human. We
            predicted that adults and children will show differences in the way
            they adjust their speech for a human versus Alexa interlocutor.
