      Hi! My name is Naina! <br /><br />I am a recent graduate from UC Davis,
      and currently the Social Media and Web Design Manger at a company based in
      Mountain View called Aerendir Mobile. <br />
      This January, I started taking classes at West Valley College to get
      formal experience in Design. From ages 9-15 I took a traditional art
      class, where I learned how to sketch, draw and paint in different mediums.
      I started using Photoshop around the age of 12, and I have been interested
      in design ever since. I decided to take an HTML/CSS class to better my
      understanding of the syntax, but I really enjoy the design aspect to web
      development the most! Eventually I hope to become a UX/UI Designer! <br />
      In my free time, I like to make jewelery, hang out with my friends, and do
      my skincare and makeup!
      <br /><br />
      Thanks for checking out my bio! <br />
