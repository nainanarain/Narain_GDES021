            Hi there! <br />My name is Naina. I graduated from the University of
            California, Davis in 2022 with Bachelor's degrees in Cognitive
            Science and Linguistics. Currently, I am the Social Media and Web
            Design Manger at a company based in Mountain View called Aerendir
            Mobile. <br />
            In January, I started taking classes at West Valley College to get
            formal experience in Design. From ages 9-15 I took a traditional art
            class, where I learned how to sketch, draw and paint in different
            mediums. I started using Photoshop around the age of 12, and I have
            been interested in design ever since. I decided to take an HTML/CSS
            class to better my understanding of the syntax, but I really enjoy
            the design aspect to web development the most! Eventually I hope to
            become a UX/UI Designer! <br />

            In my free time, I like to make make jewelry and do my skincare and
            makeup! While in college, I was knee-deep in linguistics and
            psychology research, and I sought a creative outlet. So, in the
            height of lockdown, I developed an interest in skincare, and in 2021
            I bought makeup for myself for the first time. I found these hobbies
            as an escape from an otherwise stressful time. Now, I still love to
            collect skincare and makeup products! A dream goal of mine is to
            develop my own cosmetics line!
