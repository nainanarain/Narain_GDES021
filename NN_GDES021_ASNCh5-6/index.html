      top three favorite photos I took. The scenery was amazing!

    <p>
      I love kittens! I occasionally visit Mini Cat Town in Eastridge Mall to
      hang out with kittens. Here are two images I took from my most recent
      visit.

    <!-- change this to fit the animal you like and add at least ONE <figure> and <figcaption> to one of the images, as seen on page 120. You can use that EXACT syntax -->
