    <p>
      Here are some images from when I traveled the world. These were my top
      three favorite places. The food was amazing!

    <!-- store the images you want to use in a folder called "images" - you will need to use an <img href=""/> tag to place them in your document  -->

    <p>
      I definitely consider myself a cat person. I love dogs too, but I get
      along better with cats. Here are 2 images of my favorite animals.
    </p>
    <!-- change this to fit the animal you like and add at least ONE <figure> and <figcaption> to one of the images, as seen on page 120. You can use that EXACT syntax -->

    <h2 id="favoritemovie">Favorite Movie</h2>
    <p>
      Here is a picture of my favorite movie. If you click on it, it will take
      you to my About Me page. Why? Well... because why not? ;)

    <!-- wrap your <img> tag with an <a> tag like this: <a href=""> <img src="" alt=""> </a> -->
